# Monitoring sheep activities pre and post surgery

The aim of the project is to quantify the conventional wisdom on sheep behaviors (such as herding) scientifically using an IMU (inertial measurement unit). We implemented Matlab and Python scripts to extract, analyze and visual the data. 

## Getting Started

The raw IMU data contain 10-minute 9-degree of freedom (gyroscope, linear accelerometer and magnetometer measurements) csv (comma-separated values) tables. 

### Prerequisites

* Matlab 2016
* Anaconda Python 3.5
* IMU

### Installing

It is recommended to install all the prerequisites and have suitable hardware in place. Our raw IMU csv files are located in IMUraw.zip; Acceleration measurements in Earth reference frame can be found in control.zip or treated.zip. These zip files are available upon request.
